```

## API Endpoints

### Comments API

- `GET /reports/:id/comments` - Get all comments for a report
- `PUT /comments/:id` - Update a comment
- `DELETE /comments/:id` - Delete a comment

### Request/Response Examples

#### Add Comment
```http
POST /reports/123/comments
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "content": "This is a comment about the report"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Comment added successfully",
  "comment_id": 456
}
```

#### Get Comments
```http
GET /reports/123/comments
```

Response:
```json
{
  "comments": [
    {
      "id": 456,
      "report_id": 123,
      "user_id": 789,
      "parent_id": null,
      "content": "This is a comment about the report",
      "is_edited": false,
      "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "username": "john_doe"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Database Schema

### report_comments Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE report_comments (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  report_id INT NOT NULL,
  user_id INT NOT NULL,
  parent_id INT NULL, -- For nested comments
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_edited BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  
  FOREIGN KEY (report_id) REFERENCES reports(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES report_comments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  
  INDEX idx_report (report_id),
  INDEX idx_user (user_id),
  INDEX idx_parent (parent_id),
  INDEX idx_created (created_at)
);
```

## Frontend Integration

### How Comments Work in the UI

1. **Report Popup**: When a user clicks on a report marker, the popup includes a comments section
2. **Toggle Comments**: Users can show/hide comments with a toggle button
3. **Add Comments**: Logged-in users see a textarea to add new comments
4. **Edit/Delete**: Comment authors see edit and delete buttons on their comments
5. **Real-time Updates**: Comments update immediately after any action

### Key Functions

#### `loadComments(reportId)`
Loads comments for a specific report from the API and renders them.

#### `renderComments(reportId)`
Renders the comments UI including the comment list and add comment form.

#### `submitComment(reportId)`
Submits a new comment to the API.

#### `editComment(commentId)`
Replaces comment content with an editable textarea.

#### `saveCommentEdit(commentId)`
Saves the edited comment to the API.

#### `deleteComment(commentId)`
Deletes a comment after confirmation.

#### `toggleComments(reportId)`
Shows/hides the comments section.

## Styling

The comments system uses modern CSS with:
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional appearance
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast and focus states
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly buttons and inputs

### Key CSS Classes
- `.comments-section-container` - Main container for comments
- `.comment-item` - Individual comment styling
- `.add-comment-form` - Comment form styling
- `.comment-actions` - Edit/delete buttons
- `.char-count` - Character counter styling

## Security Features

### Authentication
- All comment operations require valid JWT authentication
- User can only edit/delete their own comments
- Server-side validation of user permissions

### Input Validation
- Comment content is required and cannot be empty
- Maximum 1000 characters per comment
- HTML escaping to prevent XSS attacks
- SQL injection protection through parameterized queries

### Audit Logging
All comment actions are logged in the `audit_log` table:
- CREATE: When a comment is added
- UPDATE: When a comment is edited
- DELETE: When a comment is deleted

## Testing

### Test Page
A test page is available at `frontend-web/test-comments.html` to verify functionality.

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Open the main application
2. Click on any report marker
3. Click "Show Comments" in the popup
4. Try adding a comment (requires login)
5. Test editing and deleting comments
6. Verify responsive design on mobile

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Nested Comments**: Reply to specific comments
- **Comment Moderation**: Admin tools for moderating comments
- **Comment Notifications**: Notify users of replies
- **Comment Search**: Search through comments
- **Comment Reactions**: Like/dislike comments
- **Comment Sorting**: Sort by newest, oldest, most liked

### Technical Improvements
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live comments
- **Comment Pagination**: Load comments in pages for better performance
- **Comment Caching**: Cache frequently accessed comments
- **Comment Analytics**: Track comment engagement metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Comments Not Loading
- Check if the backend server is running
- Verify the database connection
- Check browser console for API errors
- Ensure the user is authenticated (for adding comments)

#### Comments Not Saving
- Verify the user is logged in
- Check character limit (1000 characters)
- Ensure the comment content is not empty
- Check network connectivity

#### Styling Issues
- Clear browser cache
- Verify CSS file is loaded
- Check for CSS conflicts with existing styles

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by opening browser console and looking for:
- API request/response logs
- JavaScript error messages
- Network request failures

## Deployment Notes

### Database Setup
1. Run the enhanced MySQL schema: `mysql_schema_enhanced.sql`
2. Ensure the `report_comments` table is created
3. Verify foreign key constraints are properly set

### Backend Deployment
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
2. Verify comment routes are registered in `index.js`
3. Test API endpoints with authentication

### Frontend Deployment
1. Include `comments.js` in the HTML
2. Verify CSS styles are loaded
3. Test comment functionality in production environment
